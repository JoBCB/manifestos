"Why do you rob banks?"    
"Because that's where the money is." (Willie Sutton, famous bank robber)

Last week Nettimers frolicked in the real space/time continuum on the 
Slovenian coast in the town of Piran where the following bullets were 
established:

- Nettime declares Information War.
- We denounce pan-capitalism and demand reparations. Cyberspace is where 
  your bankruptcy takes place. 
- Nettime launches crusade against data barbarism in the virtual holy land.
- We celebrate the re-mapping of the Ex-East/Ex-West and the return to 
  geography.
- We respect the return to "alt.cultures" and pagan software structures 
   ("It's normal!").
- Deprivatize corporate content, liberate the virtual enclosures and storm 
  the content castles!
- Refuse the institutionalization of net processes.
- We reject pornography on the net unless well made. 
- We are still, until this day, rejecting make-work schemes and libertarian 
  declarations of independence.
- NGOs are the future oppressive post-governments of the world. 
- We support experimental data transfer technology.
- Participate in the Nettime retirement plan, zero work by age 40. 
- The critique of the image is the defense of the imagination.
- Nettime could be Dreamtime.

Questions can be addressed to the participants at the Nettime press
