An open data manifesto: crowd sourcing a 'social contract' between governments and citizens - part 1


We will crowd source ideas for a manifesto for an open data era. We will engage people in advance of OKFest using social media, and then over the 2 days of the festival. Using a ballot box, online tools and speaking to attendees, we will collect ideas for inclusion in the manifesto. Our efforts, both before and at the festival, will ensure we get contributions from a diverse group of people - both internationally and from different backgrounds. Overnight & in the morning of the second day we will work on a first draft, which we will open up to discussion in a second session on day 2. We will publish it online so amendments can be followed as they're made. At the end we will leave the manifesto online & invite people to comment on it over the following month.

Antonio Acu√±a and Kitty von Bertele both work in the Cabinet Office in the UK. Antonio is the head of data.gov.uk and Kitty leads the policy and international work of the transparency team.

Session hashtag: #okfestballot
