Hello XXX,

this messsage is to let you know that your text,
...
has been included in the collection "Manifestos for the Internet Age".

This collection is a crowdsourced book, entirely created with free & open source software, and published on github:
https://github.com/greyscalepress/manifestos

The first version was created in March 2015, during a workshop on book prototyping given at the Fahrenheit 39 Art Book Fair, Ravenna, Italy.

There have been several additions and iterations since, the current release (as of March 2016) is version 0.7.

The layout is done with command-line tools Pandoc and Latex. You can find the PDF in the "output" folder:


A printed edition is released via print-on-demand through Amazon:
http://www.amazon.com/Manifestos-Internet-Age-Various/dp/2940561028/

I hope you enjoy this project.

I am welcoming further contributions (if you think of any other manifesto that I missed, let me know). If you would be interested in adding something like an introduction, or an interview, let me know.

Best regards,

Manuel Schmalstieg
